Only 10 DLM students are active on this portal. The other 8 are dormant. I expect that ninety percent of the class will pass this course if they put effort in it. This was the case in Term 3 of 2017. Apparently, there are usually 5 cases of students copying each other’s work but I expect that we shall not have that this time round. I also want to finish marking and returning your marks by March 16 so that you can start Assignment 2.
